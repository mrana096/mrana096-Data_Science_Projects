# Diabetes Prediction Project

## 📋 Overview
Predict the onset of diabetes using machine learning models on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The project focuses on EDA, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and explanation of results.

## 📈 Dataset
- [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- 768 rows × 9 columns
- Features like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Process
1. **EDA**: Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, missing values, and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Scaled features, selected important features based on correlation and model importance.
3. **Modeling**:
    - Trained classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
    - Compared models trained with one selected feature and multiple features.
4. **Evaluation**:
    - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC Score.
    - Confusion Matrix and ROC Curves.

## 📊 Results
- Identified key features influencing diabetes onset.
- Achieved strong classification performance using Random Forest.

## ⚙️ How to Run
```bash
Open `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb` and run all cells sequentially.
