# üß† Data Science Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of applied machine learning projects completed as part of my academic and professional development in data science. Each project addresses a real-world problem, demonstrating the use of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

These projects were selected to highlight core competencies in classification, regression, and model deployment.
